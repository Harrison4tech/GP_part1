- Description of Health Boards in Wales to choose from in Wales

7A1: Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board
7A2: Hywel Dda University Health Board
7A3: Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Local Health Board
7A4: Cardiff and Vale University Health Board

Objective 2.0: Find out information about the prescription for different classes and in health boards

# 2.1

From the data 'bnfchapter' is the unique code that represents the disease treatment/therapeutic class.

The unique code (bnfchapter) are digits between 01 and 15, 18 and 23, each representing different treatment/therapeutic class. We can furthermore see that these digits are the first two digits in' bnfchemical'. With this information we can deduce the treatment/therapeutic category from prescription data.

```{r}
# extract therapeutic class data   
dis_cat <- dbGetQuery(con, qq('select distinct bnfchapter, chapterdesc
                              from bnf
                              order by bnfchapter asc'))

cat('\nLoading therapeutic class, please wait...\n\n')
print(dis_cat)
```
- The table above show the code representing the body's therapeutic system


# 2.2

# Create a new variable (med_id) from the first two digits of the bnfcode from 'gp_data_up_to_2015' data
# This variable would help us identify different therapeutic classes as discovered in bnf data
```{r}
## Create a variable with the first two digits from the bnfcode. This will help us identify
## the body system that each item was prescribed for.

dis_tbl <- dbGetQuery(con, qq('SELECT LEFT(bnfcode, 2) AS med_id, 
                              hb, items, nic, actcost, period
                              FROM gp_data_up_to_2015'))

cat('\nLoading information, make take some time! please wait...\n\n')
print(dis_tbl)

# validate the newly created table
no_row <- nrow(dis_tbl) 
cat('\nThe total amount of entries this new table has is:', no_row,'. The new table is validated as it still contains 21596397 entries corresponding with the original gp_data_up_to_2015 data. This indicates that after creating a new variable the data has not been distorted.\n\n')

Objective 6.0: Find the statistical relationship between the rate of dementia vs the rate of smoking and diabetes
